        <h4>Justin Bieber says right side of his face is paralysed after virus attack, calls it 'pretty serious'
          condition</h4>
        <p>
          Singer Justin Bieber, 28, has revealed he has been diagnosed with a rare disorder that paralyzed half of his face and therefore he has postponed his tour until he gets better. The Grammy winner shared a video on Instagram on Friday in which he talked about his condition. He said he is suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome which causes facial paralysis and affects nerves in the face through a shingles outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>Justin shared the video after he cancelled his shows in Toronto and Washington, D.C. The singer demonstrated in the video that he could barely move one side of his face, calling the ailment “pretty serious.” He captioned it, “IMPORTANT PLEASE WATCH. I love you guys and keep me in your prayers”</p>

        <p>“For those frustrated by my cancellations of the next shows, I’m just physically, obviously not capable of doing them,” he said in the video, adding, “My body’s telling me I’ve got to slow down. I hope you guys understand.”</p>

        <p>He showed how one of his eyes wasn't blinking and said, "I can't smile on this side of my face. This nostril will not move. So there's full paralysis on this side of my face."</p>

        <p>Justin said he’s unsure how long he'll take to heal. However, he appeared positive about making a full recovery through rest and therapy and said that he has been doing facial exercises. “I’ll be using this time to just rest and relax and get back to a hundred percent, so that I can do what I was born to do,” he said.</p>


        <p>Justin's video had 14 million views in a few hours and thousands of prayers and wishes in the comments section for him to get better. Shawn Mendes wrote, “love you so much. I admire you so much.” Justin Timberlake wrote, “Love you, bro. Prayers up and sending lots of healing vibes!”</p>

        <p>Justin shot to fame as a 13-year-old as his mother used to upload his singing videos on YouTube. He went on to become a global pop phenomenon with hit chartbusters like Baby and Believe. He has two Grammy wins among 22 nominations, including a record and song of the year nods this year for Peaches.</p>

        <h4>Bill Gates says crypto and NFTs are a sham</h4>
        <p>
          Don't count Bill Gates among the fans of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Those digital asset trends are "100% based on greater fool theory," the Microsoft co-founder said Tuesday at a TechCrunch conference, referencing the notion that investors can make money on worthless or overvalued assets as long as people are willing to bid them higher.
          Gates added that he's "not long or short" crypto. And he mocked Bored Apes NFTs, joking that "expensive digital images of monkeys" will "improve the world immensely."
        </p>
        <p>Instead, Gates said he prefers old fashioned investing.</p>
        <p>"I'm used to asset classes, like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products," he said.</p>

        <p>His comments come as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are crashing. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Since then, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has lost two-thirds of its value, tumbling below $23,000 on Tuesday. It has lost about 25% of its value since Friday.
        </p>

        <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase announced that it's laying off 18% of its employees as the digital currency market continues to crumble.</p>
        <p>Gates has previously doubted crypto. In a 2021 interview with Bloomberg, Gates said that it was one thing for Elon Musk and Tesla to invest in bitcoin, but that doesn't mean average investors should follow that lead.</p>

        <p>"I do think people get bought into these manias, who may not have as much money to spare," Gates said. "So I'm not bullish on bitcoin."</p>

        <h4>Revlon: makeup icon falls to social media rivals</h4>
        <p>
          The end of the pandemic was supposed to usher in another “roaring 20s”, with bumper makeup sales as wearing lipstick became a “symbol of returning to life”. But the party is over for one of the most storied names of the makeup business, after Revlon collapsed under the weight of its debts.
        </p>
        <p>It is a story of social media star power trumping old-school glamour in today’s beauty industry.</p>

        <p>This week Revlon filed for bankruptcy protection in the US, a legal process that enables the ailing company to continue trading while it figures out how to repay its substantial debts. It is a fall from grace for the 90-year-old beauty icon, which invented matching lipstick and nail polish, and set the pace in beauty halls during much of the 20th century.</p>

        <p>During its heyday, Revlon was second only to Avon in sales, but in a sign of its ailing fortunes, the company has now fallen outside the top 20, according to a recent industry poll, as sales shift from beauty halls to the web, and celebrity brands such as Kylie Jenner-backed Kylie Cosmetics – with its near-26 million Instagram followers – and Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty are hailed as the new taste-makers.

        </p>

        <p>Revlon’s financial crisis is “not entirely surprising”, says Samantha Dover, the category director of beauty and personal care research at Mintel. “We’ve seen from our data that the recovery from Covid-19 in colour cosmetics has been quite slow. Sales recovered a bit in 2021, but by nowhere near as much as a lot of brands hoped for.”</p>


        <p>Due to the pandemic, women have become accustomed to using and buying makeup less frequently, with cosmetics sales in the UK still below pre-pandemic levels, according to Mintel. In the year to April 2020, 44% of women bought a lipstick for themselves, but in 2021 that figure dropped to 30%. It is back up at about 33% today, but Dover says this shows “how demand has dropped and not really come back yet”.</p>

        <p>The shift to home working and mandatory masks encouraged many women to neglect or ditch their makeup bag altogether, while the closure of department store beauty halls sent shoppers to the internet, a habit that has stuck. About a fifth of British women now buy their makeup online, a figure that jumps to 52% for 16-24-year-olds.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1933, Revlon is one of the industry’s most famous names. It was started by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the name. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, they started with a single product, a nail polish. Using a blended pigment formula, it was the first red nail varnish at a time when the only shades available were pale and sheer.</p>

        <p>Named Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped Hollywood starlets of their day, and is still on sale today. Lipstick became the firm’s next big item in 1940 after Charles Revson noticed a woman in a restaurant whose lips and nail polish did not match. The subsequent advertising campaign promised women “matching lips and fingertips”.</p>

        <p>It has clocked up many firsts since, including being the first beauty company to feature a black model, Naomi Sims, in its advertising in 1970. It also made a big splash in the 1980s with a supermodel campaign featuring the likes of Iman, Claudia Schiffer, Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington, which promised to make women “unforgettable”.

        </p>

        <p>Since the late 1980s, the company, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, has been controlled by the billionaire investor Ron Perelman. In 2016 it bought Elizabeth Arden for about £600m in a move that added anti-ageing creams and celebrity fragrances to a company known for selling makeup and hair dye.</p>


        <p>However Lia Neophytou, a senior consumer analyst at GlobalData, says its fragrance range mainly comprises “once iconic but now tired” brands, pointing to offerings from pop stars such as Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.</p>

        <p>The brand, with its £7 lipsticks and £9 eyeshadows, is also struggling as agile rivals reach their young audience on social media rather than via the shelves of high street stores. “Revlon should have focused more of its marketing efforts on TikTok to capture impulse spending from shoppers,” suggests Neophytou.</p>


        <p>Like other companies, Revlon, with annual sales of $2bn (£1.6bn), has also suffered from ingredient shortages and steep price rises linked to creaking global supply chains. Debra Perelman – the owner’s daughter, who has been running the company since 2018 – insisted that “consumer demand for our products remains strong”. “People love our brands and we continue to have a healthy market position,” she said.</p>

        <p>We believe everyone deserves access to information that’s grounded in science and truth, and analysis rooted in authority and integrity. That’s why we made a different choice: to keep our reporting open for all readers, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. This means more people can be better informed, united, and inspired to take meaningful action.</p>


        <p>In these perilous times, a truth-seeking global news organisation like the Guardian is essential. We have no shareholders or billionaire owner, meaning our journalism is free from commercial and political influence – this makes us different. When it’s never been more important, our independence allows us to fearlessly investigate, challenge and expose those in power.</p>
