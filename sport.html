        <h4>Barcelona chief appears to make sudden Frenkie de Jong to Man Utd transfer U-turn</h4>
        <p>
          The Catalan giants have spoken frequently about their financial problems and their need to sell before buying
          this summer but their fresh update will come as a blow to Manchester United.</p>
          <p>Barcelona have insisted that they are under no financial pressure to sell players in a blow to Manchester United's hopes of signing Frenkie de Jong.</p>

          <p>Former Ajax star De Jong is a top transfer priority for new United boss Erik ten Hag and there has been a phone call between the two already held in which the coach outlined the role the player would enjoy under him at the Red Devils.</p>

          <p>Central midfield is an area in which United need to bolster their options ahead of several key departures this term. De Jong has been identified as the leading candidate for the club in the position and the Dutchman is at the top of United's shortlist of summer transfer targets.</p>

          <p>Barca's economic vice president Eduard Romeu spoke of the club's alarming financial situation last week but has now poured cold water on suggestions that there is a pressing need for player sales. Romeu told Sport: "The number doing the most damage is asset imbalance.</p>

          <p>"The negative capital of €500million. You could add €150m to that in losses this season if we didn’t do anything. I said it before, if someone wants give me €500m...that is what we need to save Barca."</p>
          <p>Those comments came as a boost to United and their pursuit of Dutch international midfielder De Jong. With Pedri, Gavi, Sergio Busquets and the incoming Franck Kessie in the position, De Jong is their one high-value player who can be seen as dispensable within their squad.</p>

          <p>Barca would aim to recuperate the majority of the transfer fee they paid Ajax in 2019 for the midfielder, reported to be £77million – although United believe a deal can be done for closer to £68million.</p>

        <h4>Serena Williams will play Wimbledon after being given a singles wildcard</h4>
        <p>
          The 40-year-old American, who is a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, has not played since injuring herself
          in the first round at... </p>

          <p>She will make her return to tennis playing doubles at Eastbourne alongside Tunisia's Ons Jabeur in the week before Wimbledon then compete at the All England Club, where she is a seven-time singles champion.</p>

          <p>Williams' elder sister Venus, who has won the singles at Wimbledon five times and the doubles six times alongside Serena, was not in the initial batch of singles wildcards announced on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>However, the 41-year-old, who has not played on the WTA Tour since August, could still be given one of the remaining two spots for the tournament, which begins on 27 June.</p>

          <p>Serena - who earlier on Tuesday had posted an image of her trainers on grass, captioning it: "SW and SW19. It's a date" - is currently ranked 1,208 because of her prolonged inactivity.
          </p>

          <p>She won the last of her Wimbledon titles in 2016, but reached the final in 2018 and 2019 after returning from maternity leave. She last won a Grand Slam singles title at the 2017 Australian Open.</p>

          <p>The younger Williams first played in the singles event at Wimbledon as a 16-year-old in 1998 and has only missed the tournament three times since, including when pregnant with daughter Olympia in 2017.</p>

          <p>She reached the 2018 final, where she lost to Angelique Kerber, in just her fourth tournament back after giving birth.
          </p>

          <p>However, her most recent attempt to equal Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles ended in heartbreak on Centre Court last year, when she was forced to retire injured against Aliaksandra Sasnovich after slipping.

          </p>

          <p>The injury kept her out of the US Open and Australian Open that followed and there were doubts that she would return to the WTA Tour at all.</p>

          <p>Her long-time coach Patrick Mouratoglou has since started working with 2019 Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, saying in April that he had spoken to the American before taking up the position.</p>

          <p>Williams said she was "looking forward" to playing in front of fans at Eastbourne, which is the final grass-court event in the UK before Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>"I am excited to return to Eastbourne and be back on the grass - a surface that has been so good to me throughout my career," she said.</p>

        <h4>Rory McIlroy questions validity of LIV Golf again as he prepares for US Open</h4>
        <p>
          Rory McIlroy has again questioned the sporting validity of the rebel LIV Golf Series, two days after taking a
          swipe at Greg Norman in the immediate aftermath of his Canadian Open victory.</p>

          <p>The first event of the LIV scheme, backed financially by Saudi Arabia and fronted by Norman, took place last week in Hertfordshire. The build-up to the US Open, which begins at Brookline on Thursday, has been dominated by chatter about this great disruption plan. McIlroy remains a firm advocate of the existing ecosystem.

          </p>

          <p>“It’s the cloud that’s hanging over golf at the minute, right?” he said. “We are at a major championship and it’s what everyone wants to talk about so it’s on everyone’s mind.</p>

          <p>“Those crowds on Sunday in Canada, LIV is never going to have that. It’s never going to have that sense of, I don’t know what the word is… but last week meant something. What they are doing over there doesn’t really mean anything apart from just collecting a ton of money.”</p>

          <p>McIlroy subsequently pointed to the “competitive integrity” of seeing off Justin Thomas and Tony Finau in Toronto. McIlroy has been careful not to castigate his fellow professionals, including Phil Mickelson, who have been banned by the PGA Tour after accepting LIV’s lucrative overtures but he clearly remains unimpressed by their choice. “My dad said to me a long time ago, once you make your bed, you lie in it, and they’ve made their bed,” McIlroy said. “That’s their decision, and they have to live with that.”</p>

          <p>Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau pledged allegiance to the PGA Tour early this year before performing a U-turn and signing for LIV. McIlroy had claimed the breakaway looked “dead in the water” at the point of the original position. “I took a lot of players’ statements at face value,” he said. “I guess that’s what I got wrong.</p>

          <p>“You had people committed to the PGA Tour, and that’s the statements that were put out. People went back on that, so I guess I took them for face value. I took them at their word and I was wrong.”</p>

          <p>McIlroy’s expansive approach was in contrast to that of Brooks Koepka. The two-time US Open winner, whose brother Chase is part of the LIV contingent, was tetchy when asked whether there is a figure that would be sufficient to coax him towards LIV.</p>

          <p>“I haven’t given it that much thought,” Koepka said. “I’m trying to focus on the US Open. I legitimately don’t get it. I’m tired of the conversations. I’m tired of all this stuff.</p>

          <p>“Y’all are throwing a black cloud on the US Open. I think that sucks. I actually do feel bad for them [the United States Golf Association] for once because it’s a shitty situation. We’re here to play, and you are talking about an event that happened last week.”

          </p>

          <p>In a letter sent to the membership, the DP World Tour chief executive, Keith Pelley, has promised to set out a formal position next Thursday relating to LIV participation. Pelley said: “During discussions last week, and through additional private correspondence, some members asked me why we simply do not follow what the PGA Tour have done and immediately suspend these players.

          </p>

          <p>“While I understand the frustration, I remind you all that although we work closely with the PGA Tour, we are different organisations and our rules and regulations are therefore different too.</p>
